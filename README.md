## Overview
This JavaScript project is designed to keep time according to the user's device.
The images are from NASA's Image Library. The page background is the Milky Way and the clock face is the Andromeda Galaxy. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See that the time on the clock matches the time on the user device.

## My process

- HTML- Structure
- CSS - Design
- JS - Function

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Images: [NASA image Library](https://images.nasa.gov)

### Continued development

This clock will be implemented into a larger project, so it will eventuallu be more fleshed out and  interactive. This is just the basic starting place.
